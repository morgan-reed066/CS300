# CS310

The problem that I had to solve was to create a software that provided a school assistance to advisors. I approached the problem in a systematic way, taking the project one piece at a time to ensure that I had a fully functioning code. 

I had a few problems getting the code to run as I had hoped for, but nothing too bad that I couldn't handle. This project has allowed me to strengthen my abilities in sorting, such as vector sorting, that will help me in my furture coding endavors. I have managed to evolve from a more simplistic way of coding to a more complex and lengthy way, since some lines of code that I wrote are much longer than the previous ones that I had written.
